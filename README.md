### Kids Activity Pack 
  
Let's face it. With the COVID-19 pandemic across the world, children, guardians, and parents are affected by the nationwide school closures. Many guardians and parents are struggling to work and manage kids at home at the same time.

Keeping children engaged is now essential as part of an Events Best Practice. At Microsoft, our DevRel team has introduced a Kids Activity Pack that will entertain children and provide a much-needed escape into the fun and magical worlds of imagination. All these happening while our developer parents and guardians attend our conference.
